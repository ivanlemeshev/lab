# Sandbox for learning, exploring and experimenting

_Learning happens in the lab, not the lecture hall._

This repository is a sandbox for learning, exploring and experimenting with
various programming languages, technologies, tools, and techniques. It is a
place to try things out, make mistakes, and learn from them. The idea is to
have a place to play around with things without worrying about breaking
anything important.

The idea of this repository is taken from the
[rwxrob/lab](https://github.com/rwxrob/lab) repository.
